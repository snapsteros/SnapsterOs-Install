Welcome to Snapster OS installation tour!
All you need is to download these files as .zip or .tar.xz and have a booted Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or other Ubuntu versions).
Now, open your terminal and write:
sudo apt install-gnome-tweaks

Then, extract the .zip files you downloaded and in your terminal, write:
sudo nautilus

After, add the RR Gradient to usr>share>themes

Add the scarce-green and scarce-green-dark to usr>share>icons

Add the GTK3 theme to usr>share>themes

Add the background picture to the backround boxes for both Lock and desktop screen.

After you do this, open tweaks from the applications place and click on Appearance.
For app icons, click on icons and choose scarce-green-dark (note: It won't work if you do not put the scarce-green file also to nautilus or if you choose scarce-green in tweaks. They are the same things; but won't work without each other.)
For window themes, choose applications and GTK3 theme.
For themes, choose themes and RR Gradient theme*.
And lastly, go to windows on the left menu, and choose 'right' at the bottom of the page, placement.

Thanks for using SnapsterOS powered by Ubuntu Linux and gnome-look.org
